DATED TIME OF BUILD # IS 12/28/2022

WALIWO MAIN BACKEND LANGUAGE IS PYTHON
BY USING FLASK WE ARE ABLE TO RENDER DOCUMENT MODELS AND MORE TO THE FRONTEND

IMPORTED MODUELS MAY NEEED TO BE INSTALLED FROM YOUR PYTHON OR NPM PACKAGE MANAGER IN ORDER FOR SOME CODE TO WORK 
IF YOU INTEND ON ADDING OR REMOVING FILES PLEASE MAKE SURE TO NOT EDIT THE FOLLOWING

'APP.PY'=THIS IS THE MAIN PYTHON PROGRAM INITIATOR THAT RUNS THE ROUTES TO ALL THE APPS, IF YOU EDIT THIS FILE MAKE SURE TO NOT BREAK ANY OTHER ROUTES

==RULES==

DUE TO HOW THE JINJA AND FLASK SYNTAX WORKS FILES MUST BE PLACES IN SPECIFIC SOTS IN ORDER TO RUN PROPERLY; FILES SUCH AS CSS,JAVASCRIPT,HTML FILES ARE CATEGRIZED DIFFRENTLY

'HTML' FILES MUST GO IN THE TEMPLATES FOLDER IN ORDER TO RUN
STYLE FILES AND SCRIPT FILES LIKE .JS MUST GO IN STATIC IN ORDER TO RUN AND ALSO MUST INCLUDE A SPECIAL WAY TO LINK THE FILE IN THE HTML DOCUMENT

THE NAMES OF THESE FILES CANNOT BE CHANGED AS THE FRAMEWORK ONLY ALLOWS THESE FOLDER NAMES FOR ROUTING

==MORE==

IN THE HTML DOCUMENTS INSIDE THE FORM TAGS; A INPUT FEILD WILL HAVE A VARIABLE CALLED NAME, THAT NAME VARIABLE IS THE VARIABLE THAT LINKS TO THE FLASK ROUTING FILE 
FOR EXAMPLE:
       <FORM METHOD='POST'>
			  <INPUT TYPE="EMAIL" NAME="EMAIL"/>
				</FORM>
			THE VAR NAME HAS THE STR OF EMAIL THIS CONNECTS TO THE FLASK ROUTING CODE THAT LOOKS FOR THIS AND CONNECTS AND GETS TH METHOD ASOCIATED WITH IT
